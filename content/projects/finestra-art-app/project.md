# Finestra Art App

Finestra is a mobile application designed to help users discover and experience local art in their community. The app allows art enthusiasts to find installations, galleries, and events, as well as to create and share their own artistic experiences.

## Project Goals

- Create an intuitive interface for discovering art installations and events
- Enable users to record and share their experiences with art
- Build a community around local art scenes
- Provide tools for artists to promote their work

## Design Process

I started with extensive user research to understand the needs of both art enthusiasts and artists. This included interviews, surveys, and observation sessions at local galleries and art events.

### Research Insights

- Users wanted a way to discover art that wasn't curated by major institutions
- Local artists needed better ways to promote their work
- Art enthusiasts wanted to share their experiences with friends
- Many users wanted tools to learn more about art they encountered

### Design Solutions

Based on these insights, I developed wireframes and prototypes for the core features:

1. Art discovery map
2. Event calendar
3. Recording tool for art experiences
4. Artist profiles and portfolios

## Final Design

The final design incorporated an intuitive map-based interface with filtering options, a robust event system, and social features that allowed users to connect with artists and other enthusiasts.

## Results

- Successfully launched on iOS with 10,000+ downloads in first month
- Featured in App Store's "New Apps We Love" section
- Positive user feedback highlighting the discovery features
- Partnered with 50+ local galleries in first year

## Learnings

This project taught me valuable lessons about designing for diverse user groups with different needs and expectations. The challenge of creating an interface that served both casual users and professional artists pushed me to develop flexible design patterns that could adapt to different use cases.
