# About Me

I'm a product designer with over 10 years of experience creating user-centered digital experiences. My approach combines strategic thinking with creative problem-solving to craft products that are both useful and delightful.

## My Journey

My career began at the intersection of technology and art, where I developed a passion for creating digital tools that empower people. Over the years, I've worked with startups, agencies, and established companies to design products across various industries including healthcare, data visualization, marketing technology, and consumer applications.

## Design Philosophy

I believe that great design comes from a deep understanding of people's needs and contexts. My process always begins with empathy and research, seeking to understand not just what users say they want, but what will truly solve their problems and fit into their lives.

I'm particularly interested in the thoughtful application of design systems, creating cohesive experiences that scale while maintaining human touches that make products feel personal and engaging.

## Areas of Expertise

- **UX Strategy & Research**: Turning user insights into actionable design direction
- **Information Architecture**: Organizing complex information in intuitive ways
- **Interactive Prototyping**: Bringing ideas to life to test and refine concepts
- **Data Visualization**: Making complex data accessible and meaningful
- **Design Systems**: Creating scalable, consistent design languages

## Beyond Design

When I'm not designing, you might find me experimenting with new creative tools, contributing to open-source projects, or exploring nature trails with my camera. I believe that diverse experiences and continuous learning are essential to staying creative and bringing fresh perspectives to design challenges.

I'm always open to discussing new opportunities, collaborations, or just connecting with fellow designers and technologists. Feel free to reach out!
